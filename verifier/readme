Note:

The file builtin.sml, heap.sml, lightenv.sml, pattern.sml is exactly same to that of liquid type implementation

constraint.sml is updated. The verification task is moved to vc.sml. We will not invoke theorem prover for each
constraint; instead, these constraints will be transform to a verification condition in vc.sml and given to
theorem prover for verification

constraintgen.sml scans sml file only in sytax form and generates all the liquid type rules.

modelcheck.sml receives the above rules and organizes them by their belonging of bindings. modelcheck maintains
a worklist and verify each function modularly by giveing each binding's rules to vc.sml.

vc.sml recevies the binding's rules and obtain verification condition from it. Theorem prover call is embeded
in vc.
